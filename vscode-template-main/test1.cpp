different data types are as follows
int: Whole numbers (1,2,300) 
char: Single letters or characters (a,t,h,!)
boolean: True or false values
float: decimal values of up to 7 points 
double: decimal value of up to 15 points (you don't always need double which is why it's handier to use floats. Float also saves on memory)

/*
Variables are defined by 32 parts
it's name, value and type
These determine what can be done to a value. It doesn't matter what name or type it is, it's just a box to store values.

Variables must be delcared before use
e.g 
int numberofBalloons;
numofballoons = 9;

int = takes numbers;
numberofBalloons = name
numofballons = value

If you just write "int numberofBalloons" then it's unitialised 
once you create "numberofballoons = 6" then its initialised 

You can also write it as "int numberofBalloons{6}"

Expersions can also be used using the symbols below
== - equal to 
!= - notEqual to
< - less than 
> - greater than
<= - Lesser equal
>= - Greater equal

We use booleans when we want to create a certain level of conditions and rules. This will help make a loop 
below is an example of a loop
    int sheepeatenbywolf {99};
    while (sheepeatenbywolf>0);
    {
        printf(Om nom nom);
        sheepeatenbywolf = sheepeatenbywolf -1;
    } */

/* if the "while" part of the loop is kept empty or says "true" and nothing else then the loop will loop for ever and ever
